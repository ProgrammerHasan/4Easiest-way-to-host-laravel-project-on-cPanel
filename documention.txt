#First Way:

and then add this code  -> 
#this code rewire your laravel public folder

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]
</IfModule>



#Second Way: 
Change server.php file to index.php
and then copy public/.htaccess file to domain root dir
Or Create .htaccess file on your domain root dir and Add this code .

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    <IfModule mod_negotiation.c>
        Options -MultiViews -Indexes
    </IfModule>

    RewriteEngine On

    # Handle Authorization Header
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
    RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

    # Redirect Trailing Slashes If Not A Folder...
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} (.+)/$
    RewriteRule ^ %1 [L,R=301]

    # Handle Front Controller...

    </Files>

</IfModule>


#Third way: 
Change your domain root path like this: public_html/public
How: Go to your subdomains list then change this root path


#Fourth Way: 
Move all public folder files to domain root dir and then create a folder for move all app files
Create a new directory named public_html/myapp on your host.

Inside your Laravel project you have a public directory. Copy the content of that public directory into the public_html/myapp directory you created on your host.

On the same level with public_html folder (not inside it!), create a new directory named myapp-laravel on your host.

Excepting the public folder, copy every folder and file (ex. app folder, .env file, ...) from your Laravel project into the myapp-laravel folder on your host.

Edit the public_html/myapp/index.php file like this:

Change require
__ DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';
to 
require __DIR__.'/appMain/vendor/autoload.php';
Change
require_once __ DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';
to
$app = require_once __DIR__.'/appMain/bootstrap/app.php';
